Message 22.2.2020, Saturday, 6.00-7.00 am<br>
    Sheep did not hear them!</header> 

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Joh 10:8 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br>  
On 17.2.2020 Monday, while coming back from the station, we hired a taxi. The driver was an anti-Christian.  He went on criticizing and accusing Christians & Jesus. When he spoke about Jesus, I felt bad and hence replied.<br> 
"Where was he born? Is there His name mentioned in Bible?" He asked ridiculously.<br> 
I replied,<br> 
"We Christians, have failed to follow Jesus Christ's principles. That's true. But Jesus is a living God. He did not create any religion. He showed only a way, way to heaven.  He carried our sins, curses, died and resurrected. He is the living God. Don't accuse Jesus because of our mistakes."<br>
He continued,<br>
"In Jesus Christ's name, (oru paradesi) one sojourner, (by name) who was lying  in the platform, started a ministry. Now he is a correlating with so many buildings, acres of land etc. Isn't it all people's money? Is he not robbing people in God's name? He says, "don't wear ornaments. Give it all to me as offerings!  Is it not robbery?"<br>
First I felt angry at this driver.  But Slowly I came to realize the truth, this is the image Christianity, we, have  given to the common man in India.<br>
In between, even he was attending a phone call (I think from his sister, it was on speaker so we could also hear,) "Anna, why are you continuously driving like this? Can’t you take rest at least once in two or three days?<br> 
His reply:  'That's O.K ma. I need some money now.  So I am driving continuously for  30 hours. I take bath in the public pipes. If I need rest, I will halt the car on the roadside for some time. Don't worry. If I come that side, I will visit you".<br>
After listening to this phone call, my bitterness towards him started melting, I felt like listening to him. <br>  
In a country where people are working even 30 hours continuously for making both ends meet, what is the image Christianity offered for Jesus?
Christianity is easy going life, making windfall money, etc.etc.
Is there any contributions we, Christians have made to the development of this nation? Hon’ble Arvind Kejriwal, CM Delhi, who has presented a clean Govt is from Hindu background who has received inspiration from Jesus and Bible. No Church has claim over him.<br> 
'All who came before Jesus, were thieves and robbers ' Jesus said. Let us analyze this “All" category! <br>
1. Kings. From Saul to Zedekiah all the kings exploited and killed people in thousands and lakhs, for making their throne secure, and to pass it on to their children.<br>
2. Prophets. Who were appointed and maintained in paid profession, by kings in the palace, to give the brand 'seal of God'  to all that the atrocities the  kings did.<br> 
3. The priests. Who lived on the clean tithe of the people who did not do any work at all?<br>
All these three were robbers & thieves, the Lord said.
Now today, what about all those who came after Jesus?<br><br>

In N.T. the Lord destroyed all the above 3 categories of O.T. (Priest, individual prophet & king). <br>
Today believers are the kings and priests. Rev. 5:10, 1 Pe 2:9, Rev 1:6
Rev 5:10 And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth. <br> 
But the institutional Church has brought back the old system of 'robbers & thieves'. <br><br> 

What is the result?<br>
"But the sheep did not hear them".<br>
Today the common man in India, (123 crores out of 128 crores), do not want to listen to any pastor, any evangelist. <br> 
In these 7 years (2014-2020) the Lord has exposed the robberies, crimes, exploitation and discriminations done by the Church (inside & outside). 
The Lord did it with the help of Central and local governments. 
So let us be careful, not to exploit, steal or rob from  any man or woman!  Never let us eat people's money or labor! Keeping ourselves away from the above, is our first duty!  Expecting nothing from the people, not even a thanks! <br>
2 Co 1:24 Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.<br> 
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">Never have dominion over the faith of people!
<li>2. Equip each one as Disciples 
Let us   equip the people to be disciples of Jesus Christ, to teach them,  how  to exercise  all the gifts of the Holy Spirit ( theory and practice).<br>
What we have lost in 2000 years can be compensated this way 
<li>3. Make each one a leader in Jesus Christ 
Develop their human skills also! The skill of leadership, skill of writing, the skill of singing,
o	the skill of teaching, the skill of communication, skill of hospitality, skill of cooking, skill of using media etc.
Let’s equip our AOJ people to do some service to humanity!  Jesus served the humanity!<br> </p> 
<footer style="font-size: 22px;">Let's ask pardon for all the sins, scandals, omissions committed by the Church in India in the past 2000 years!</footer>
