<h3> 22.4.2020 Conference Prayer for Regional Coordinators  - Message  </h3>
<b><p style="font-size: 20px";>There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was
Dan 12:1  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.<br> 
The world is facing such a time now, a time of trouble unprecedented  in the history of humanity. But there is a good news for his children. 
Thy people shall be delivered. Everyone that shall be found written in the book.</p><br> 
<p> When were your name added into the book? <br> 
<ol><li>When you committed to obey the commandment of Jesus Mat 28:19,20</li>
<li>	When you decided to come out of the dead Church</li>
<li>	When you started to teach others the commandments of Jesus</li>
<li>When you started teaching to observe all things whatsoever Jesus commanded us</li>
<li>	When you decided to give baptism </li>
<li>	 When you decided to exercise the authority Jesus gave to you</li>
<li>	When you were recruited into His Army to fight with satan for Him</li>
<li>	When you started loving Jesus more than your father, mother, brothers, sisters wife, husband, children </li></ol></p>
<p>When the Lord gave the strategy of Troop Church we travelled from one end to the other end of India to propagate this. The first question people asked invariably was<br>
If we leave the institutional Church, where will we get grave?”<br>
Second question was,<br>
How will we solemnize the marriage of our children.
These two have become the priority of Christians in the institutional Churches. They have come to such a comfortable state to forget about the evangelizing duty  of the Church, reaching out the gentiles, preaching gospel and  renouncing all securities for the sake of gospel.<br> 
Celebrating marriage function, funeral service in the most attractive way has become the fashion of the Churches this day.<br>
I was recollecting verses from the Bible of  funeral and burial issues.<br> </p>
<p>Isa 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
In the modern society, there has been a tendency to believe that a good Christian is the one who gets a decent death and a decent burial. The family members consider it as their duty to conduct the burial service as ostentatious  as possible. Christians do not seem to worry much about where the soul goes after death or about the eternal life but they make the funeral service a real show.<br> 
Most of the Christians who have membership in any one of the organizational Churches will have the first guarantee of a burial place.<br></p>
<p>Jesus  got grave with the wicked. He died on the cross, crucified in the middle of two robbers.<br>
Paul said,<br>
Php 3:10  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br> 
Paul wanted to be in conformity with Christ in His death.<br> 
Can Christian desire for a better burial and funeral other than that of Jesus Christ?<br></p>
<p>Yesterday I went through  a media narration of what happened to the body of Dr. Simon Hercules, a Christian Neurologist who was running a Hospital in the heart of the city of Chennai under the name New Hope Hospital. He was tested positive 15 days back, admitted to the best renowned hospital Appollo in Chennai. After 15 days he succumbed to the attack of Covid 19 & breathed his last. After all the formalities, the dead body was taken to the burial ground. But the nearby people, did not allow his body to be buried. According to the video narration, they brought gundas to attack  the van and those who were  inside the van. After trying to convince them in vain, the body was taken to another burial ground and buried.<br></p>
<p>This is the second incident happening in Chennai. The earlier was also that of a doctor from Nellore who died in Chennai. When his body was brought to the burial ground by the hospital workers, the  inhabitants of that area gave problems to them. It ended up in leaving  the body in the burial ground. It was left there unclaimed. After that the police  interfered and the body was buried.<br></p>
<p>What all these incidents tell us?<br>
The Lord is teaching the Church and the people who had made secure their burial ground, the  lesson of a  true believer’s concept on death and burial.<br><p> 
<p>Mat 27:58  He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<br>
Jesus was aware of his death, burial and the rituals of Jews to be done during burial. He knew none of these will be done to His body during burial.<br>
Mar 14:8  She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.<br>
Jesus asked us not  to be  bothered about the physical death.<br> 
Luk 12:4  And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Jesus knew His body will be broken to pieces.<br> 
Jesus body was given a decent burial as per the Jews even though Jesus did not plan for it. The Father Almighty had planned it.<br>
Joh 19:40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.<br>
As long as we are in this body, we are away from God. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: </p>
<p>2Co 5:1-6  For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.  For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.<br> 
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <br>
Let us pray for the health workers, doctors, nurses, other staffs of hospitals, police and people who are serving in the public utility services. </p><br><br>









<h3> 22.2.2020, Saturday, 6.00-7.00 am<br>
    Sheep did not hear them!</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Joh 10:8 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br>  
On 17.2.2020 Monday, while coming back from the station, we hired a taxi. The driver was an anti-Christian.  He went on criticizing and accusing Christians & Jesus. When he spoke about Jesus, I felt bad and hence replied.<br> 
"Where was he born? Is there His name mentioned in Bible?" He asked ridiculously.<br> 
I replied,<br> 
"We Christians, have failed to follow Jesus Christ's principles. That's true. But Jesus is a living God. He did not create any religion. He showed only a way, way to heaven.  He carried our sins, curses, died and resurrected. He is the living God. Don't accuse Jesus because of our mistakes."<br>
He continued,<br>
"In Jesus Christ's name, (oru paradesi) one sojourner, (by name) who was lying  in the platform, started a ministry. Now he is a correlating with so many buildings, acres of land etc. Isn't it all people's money? Is he not robbing people in God's name? He says, "don't wear ornaments. Give it all to me as offerings!  Is it not robbery?"<br>
First I felt angry at this driver.  But Slowly I came to realize the truth, this is the image Christianity, we, have  given to the common man in India.<br>
In between, even he was attending a phone call (I think from his sister, it was on speaker so we could also hear,) "Anna, why are you continuously driving like this? Can’t you take rest at least once in two or three days?<br> 
His reply:  'That's O.K ma. I need some money now.  So I am driving continuously for  30 hours. I take bath in the public pipes. If I need rest, I will halt the car on the roadside for some time. Don't worry. If I come that side, I will visit you".<br>
After listening to this phone call, my bitterness towards him started melting, I felt like listening to him. <br>  
In a country where people are working even 30 hours continuously for making both ends meet, what is the image Christianity offered for Jesus?
Christianity is easy going life, making windfall money, etc.etc.
Is there any contributions we, Christians have made to the development of this nation? Hon’ble Arvind Kejriwal, CM Delhi, who has presented a clean Govt is from Hindu background who has received inspiration from Jesus and Bible. No Church has claim over him.<br> 
'All who came before Jesus, were thieves and robbers ' Jesus said. Let us analyze this “All" category! <br>
1. Kings. From Saul to Zedekiah all the kings exploited and killed people in thousands and lakhs, for making their throne secure, and to pass it on to their children.<br>
2. Prophets. Who were appointed and maintained in paid profession, by kings in the palace, to give the brand 'seal of God'  to all that the atrocities the  kings did.<br> 
3. The priests. Who lived on the clean tithe of the people who did not do any work at all?<br>
All these three were robbers & thieves, the Lord said.
Now today, what about all those who came after Jesus?<br><br>

In N.T. the Lord destroyed all the above 3 categories of O.T. (Priest, individual prophet & king). <br>
Today believers are the kings and priests. Rev. 5:10, 1 Pe 2:9, Rev 1:6
Rev 5:10 And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth. <br> 
But the institutional Church has brought back the old system of 'robbers & thieves'. <br><br> 

What is the result?<br>
"But the sheep did not hear them".<br>
Today the common man in India, (123 crores out of 128 crores), do not want to listen to any pastor, any evangelist. <br> 
In these 7 years (2014-2020) the Lord has exposed the robberies, crimes, exploitation and discriminations done by the Church (inside & outside). 
The Lord did it with the help of Central and local governments. 
So let us be careful, not to exploit, steal or rob from  any man or woman!  Never let us eat people's money or labor! Keeping ourselves away from the above, is our first duty!  Expecting nothing from the people, not even a thanks! <br>
2 Co 1:24 Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.<br> 
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">Never have dominion over the faith of people!
<li>2. Equip each one as Disciples 
Let us   equip the people to be disciples of Jesus Christ, to teach them,  how  to exercise  all the gifts of the Holy Spirit ( theory and practice).<br>
What we have lost in 2000 years can be compensated this way 
<li>3. Make each one a leader in Jesus Christ 
Develop their human skills also! The skill of leadership, skill of writing, the skill of singing,
o	the skill of teaching, the skill of communication, skill of hospitality, skill of cooking, skill of using media etc.
Let’s equip our AOJ people to do some service to humanity!  Jesus served the humanity!<br> </p> 


<p>Let's ask pardon for all the sins, scandals, omissions committed by the Church in India in the past 2000 years!</p>
