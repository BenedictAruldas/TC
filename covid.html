	<h2>“Believe in Jesus” <br>
	“What Jesus is not” </h1>
<h3>
Dear all, <br>
Please hear this message!<br>
JESUS CHRIST<br>
Is the only solution for Covid 19!<br><br>
Jesus is the only way to escape from this pandemic!<br>
Jesus is not a Religion! Jesus is not a structure or a hierarchical system! <br>
Jesus is not  in huge  buildings, <br>
Jesus is not an organization!<br>
He is the Son of God who came to earth to reconcile Man to God the Almighty.. <br>
Jesus is  a person, the incarnation of God  <br>
He  did not come  to establish  a religion on earth. But only asked us to love everyone and to forgive everyone.  <br><br>
He has given only two commands!<br><br>
Love God and <br>
Love your neighbour!<br><br>
Do not be deceived by  organizations or persons who demand money in the name of Jesus, for constructing buildings, or for any other need! 
Violation of the commandment of love has brought this wrath of God on  this earth! <br>
To know about Jesus,  read  the Bible. It contains  all the laws that God  the Creator has  given to  humanity. <br>
God  is our Creator and  Life giver. <br>
God is love.  He is our loving  Father. Let’s love our neighbours  irrespective of caste, religion, nationality.. All human beings are our brothers and sisters. <br>
God does not want people to die of the plague. He wants us to leave our evil ways and turn to Him! Then we will live.<br>
No religion, religious structures, not even Christian religion can save humanity from this plague!<br>
Believe in Jesus! Accept His commands!<br>
Accept Jesus as your personal Saviour and Lord. Bible  will speak to you  who Jesus is!  Jesus did not establish any religion. He came to eradicate religion from the earth and to connect humanity with God risking His own life!  Jesus only can forgive our sins and take us to heaven! <br>
Let’s love God and love our neighbours! Let us serve humanity, irrespective of caste, creed or religion!<br>
Let us make the world a happy and safe place to live.!<br>
