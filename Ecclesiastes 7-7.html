<h2>Ecclesiastes 7:7 Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</h2>

<h3> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pmay-9-panchayat-secretaries-suspended-in-tiruvannamalai/article32590623.ece?utm_campaign=article_share&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=whatsapp.com" style="color:red">  

Today nine panchayat secretaries are suspended in Tiruvannamalai over the irregularities in the implementation of the Prime Minister Awas Yojana housing scheme.</a>The grant which is suppose to benefit the homeless and poor has gone into the pockets of these government officials. The knowledgeable officials who are suppose to administer our land have become fools as their heart became corrupt  by bribe and unjust gains. <br>
There are similar irregularities which are found in many of the Government Department and Scheme. </h3>

<h2>Ezekiel 22:29 The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.</h2>

<h3>God's heart is always inclined towards the poor, needy, widow, alien and the fatherless hence any society which denies the justice to these people will be punished severely. </h3>

<h2>Ezekiel 22:13 'I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.  </h2>

<h3>Today the Lord is doing exactly what he had warned us. He has taken up the case of the oppressed and striking the society which extorted the poor. HE has entered into judgment with us. <br><br>

Let us all behalf of our country ask forgiveness for all the injustice. Let us thank the Lord for his Judgements on our Nation. <br><br><br>

 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ King of King's and Lord of lords.<br>

	1) We bind and destroy the spirit of bribery which makes our officials fools and corrupts the heart.  <br>
	2) We bind and destroy the work of Devil which has made the people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery by oppressing the poor and the aliens. <br>
	3) We declare and decree that the government officials fear God and keep away from bribery and unjust gains. Let them delight on Justice and hate extorsion. Let them be upright. Let their heart be inclined towards the poor, needy, widow, alien and the fatherless. Let all the malpractice by Government officials be judged severely.<br><br>

We seal the decree by the precious blood of Jesus and by the Holy Spirit. </h3>
