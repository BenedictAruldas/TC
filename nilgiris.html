	<h3>Basic infrastructure</h3>
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>The <b> Nagapattina  Gudalur National Highway </b>passes through this district. The <b>Nilgiri Ghat Roads</b> link Nilgiris with nearby cities in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. All the taluks are connected with major roads. Ooty bus stand serves as the central bus stand for the district, along with Municipal Bus Stand, Coonoor (built in 1960). Several crucial Ghat roads were cut in the 19th century.[23] The village roads are maintained by the Panchayat Union.<br><br>

The Nilgiri Mountain Railway from Mettupalayam to Udhagamandalam via Coonoor, is a great tourist attraction.[24] It was filmed in A Passage to India, representing the railway to the caves. It is a Swiss-designed rack railway as far as Coonoor. The railway is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.[25] It serves many of the more heavily populated areas of the district, including Coonoor, Wellington, Aruvankadu, Ketti, Lovedale and Ooty. There is no seaport or airport in the district; the nearest airport is Coimbatore.</p><br><br>
