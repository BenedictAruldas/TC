<p>Today is an important day in Indian History, It can also be said as the beginning of a new era, the era of liberated India. </p>

 <p>India has produced its prophets who build up the walls and stand before The Lord behalf of the Land so that he might not destroy it.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 36:35-36 35They will say, "This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited." 36Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the LORD have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.',</p>
 
<p>Romans 8:19-22 19For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. 20For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. 22We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</p>

<p>Today is the day where Godâ€™s Children are revealed.</p>

<p>In Genesis 1:28 gave authority over the Natural Resources <br>
