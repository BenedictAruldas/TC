	<h1>Revelation of 16.6.2006</h1>

<h1>The Lord spoke through Gen. Chapter 41. The coming 14 years for India will be divided into two major parts  The first 7 years will be the years of abundance and the latter that of famine. In the first 7 years abundance will be seen everywhere</h1><br><br>

<ol><li>	In all the churches</li>
<li>	In all the ministries</li></ol><br><br>

Abundance in the pouring out of the Holy Spirit will be in:

1.	The rise in the number of the servants of God, ministers, preachers, evangelists, prophets, pastors and believers
2.	In the manifestation of the various gifts of the Holy Spirit
3.	In obtaining favours and privileges from the civil and political authorities for the gospel work
4.	In the openings of new doors for ministries
5.	 In the interpretations of the Word of God
6.	In translating  Bible into unknown languages
7.	Stepping into unknown and untread areas of the country
8.	Increase in visions, dreams, revelations and other graces
9.	Coming in of evangelists from foreign countries
10.	Evangelization through children
11.	The dumb will open up their mouths and proclaim the gospel.
12.	Those who are against Christ will accept Him and become powerful witnesses
13.	Churches will be united and will function under one leadership


The second part, the latter 7 years will be years of persecution, sufferings and famine for the Word. The signs will be:

1.	Many leading servants of God will die as martyrs
2.	The fellowships of believers will be destroyed and they will be scattered
3.	Children will die as martyrs
4.	Many will backslide, reject Christ and will go after worldly pleasures
5.	Great famine for the Word

The severity  and nature of the famine can be understood from Gen.41:21

“But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before”.

This clearly states that during the latter half, the very trace of abundance will disappear and nobody would be able to believe that India had had such a period of abundance.



I was led to fast and pray for 9 days for further revelations on this and  to know what we have to do. The Lord spoke on 20.6.2006.

The responsibility of the Servants of God and the Churches

Both the servants of God and the churches of India have great responsibility towards this.

1.  Gen.41:34     - 1/5 of the produce of the land in the years of abundance should be           
                               taken as reserve for the period of famine

2.  Produce	  -   Believers, ministers of the Word
	
3. In all the churches missionary orientation should be given to believers and  
one fifth of all the believers in all the churches should be sent as missionaries.

4.  The land is going to produce good yield.  All the doors will be opened for Ministry. 
         
5. This revelation should be shared with pastors and evangelizers.

6.	Hereafter no church believers should be left idle. 20% of the believers should be collected compulsorily, and should be sent to the northern States.  This has to be made as a law for all the churches and should be enforced.  For churches will not give them voluntarily. This 20 % is the reserve against famine. Gen.21: 34. The church has no claim over it.

Warning!
 “If any church refuses to give 20% so that the country will have sufficient food during famine, I will send my wrath against them.  I will even destroy them. Smuggling, hiding, not showing the right statistics will also bring punishment”.

				        Tamil Nadu
In this mission the responsibility of Tamil Nadu is the greatest.  The light which will enlighten the whole nation will come forth from Tamil Nadu. A light will shine forth from Kanyakumari and it will reach Kashmir, giving light to the whole nation.

Every Church in Tamil Nadu
Every Church in Tamil Nadu should adopt a State. 

From 2007
Will start the years of abundance. Collecting the reserve should start right from the beginning of 2007.  Appointing supervisors for this, taking the survey of the churches and believers, should start from now onwards.  There should be a competitive spirit among the churches as to who gives more.

Christians to be displaced

“And as for the people, he removed   them   to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the  other end thereof ".  Gen.47:21

Church should displace believers (professionals, industrialists, educationists, farmers, businessmen etc) from South to North

Christians in North  India
Genesis 47:27 
    “And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly”. 

Those who migrate to North India will flourish.  They will multiply exceedingly.
All the Churches & Christians are invited to harvest fields in the next 7 years from 2007-2013
Implementation
2 Ki. 6:1,2 & 2 Ki. 4:2-7
When we asked the Lord, what we have to do and how to go forth in implementing the same, 

1.	 The Lord gave 2 Ki.6:1,2.  
       
The believers of the Church are going to ask their pastors,
